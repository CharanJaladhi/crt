Variables in Javascript:
In javascript, variables are used to store and manipulate data. They provide a way to store
values of different types,cas numbers, strings, boolean, arrays, objects and more.
1. variables declaration: To declare variables in javascript, use the 'var' or 'let' or
'const' keyword followed by the variable name.
Eg: var age; //variable declaration using var
let name; // variable declaration using 'let'
const pi=3.14; // variable declaration using 'const'
1. The var keyword used to declare variables traditionally.
2. The let keyword used for block scoped variables, such they are only accessible within the block 
of code when they are defined.
3. The const keyword is used for constants, which are variables that cannot be re-assigned
after they are declared. They must be initialized with a value.

1. Variable Initialization:
Eg: var age=19; //Variable declare and initialized
let name="Zames";

Variable scope: Java script has function scope and block scope.
1. Variables declared with var have function scope. They are accessible throught out the function in 
which they are defined regardless of block scope.
2. Variables declared with 'let' and 'const' have block scope. They are only accesible with in the block of code 
where they are defined.
(eg: if block)
